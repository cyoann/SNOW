### Components

- **1-Wire DS18B20 Temperature Sensors**:

  The DS18B20 is a digital temperature sensor that communicates via a 1-Wire bus, providing temperature readings with an accuracy of 9 to 12 bits.

  Using the OneWire protocol, multiple sensors can be connected to a single GPIO pin on the microcontroller. Each sensor has its own 64-bit address, enabling the microcontroller to communicate efficiently with each of them via the same data line. This configuration makes it easy to identify and retrieve temperature data from each sensor.

  By adapting the sensor resolution, you can customize the trade-off between temperature accuracy and conversion speed. Choosing a higher resolution improves accuracy while extending conversion time.

  See the table below :

  | Resolution (bits) | Precision (Â°C) | Conversion Time (ms) |
  | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
  | 9                 | 0.5            | 93.75                |
